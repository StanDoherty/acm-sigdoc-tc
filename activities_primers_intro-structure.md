# Introduction to Structured Information (DRAFT)

My first exposure to the notion of "structure" was a negative one. I had just completed a long API documentation project which delivered hundreds of identically structured and formatted Microsoft Word files. My boss gathered several us to meet with a consultant making the rounds through the company to talk about SGML and "structured authoring". In that first memorable meeting, we were informed that everything that we had been producing in Microsoft Word or Framemaker was unstructured content. We were not doing anything wrong, but none of it was really implemented in a way that made it "structured". For writers coming off projects that involved meticulous outlining, religiously consistent headings within API topics, and thorough editing, them's fightin' words and we, of course, did most everything in our limited spheres to impede or delay the roll-out of SGML. 

Completely unnecessary.

If the consultant had led with, "I'm here today to tell you about hyper-epi-meta- mogrified content and what it might mean for our future," I guarantee that we (I) would have responded better as adults and professionals. No threat. No judgements. 

Writers who have spent years writing term papers in Word or user guides in MadCap Flare have a working, lived sense of effectively structured content that has NOTHING to do XML, schema, or validation. If 90% of the successful writers in an organization share a general sense of what constitutes a well-structured essay or help topic, you want to build on that collective understanding without attempting to replace it.
