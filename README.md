# Technical Committee Formation Team

This GitHub repo is dedicated to developing a proposal to the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) [SIGDOC](https://sigdoc.acm.org/) (Special Interest Group on the Design of Communication) for a technical committee named **Structured Information Development and Management**.

## TC Charter (DRAFT)

This TC seeks to promote the benefits of structured information and information management for industry practitioners and teachers. Under the guidance of the SIGDOC Executive Committee, our proposed TC would be active in developing technical papers, pedagogical (curriculum) content, webinar workshop materials, conference workshop materials, and industry speaker directories. 

We have two short-term activities:

* *Before SIGDOC approval*: Recruit founding members from industry and academia who are supportive of the work of the proposed TC.
* *After SIGDOC approval*: Develop an initial set of deliverables for the [2022 ACM SIGDOC Conference](https://sigdoc.acm.org/conferences/) (October 6-8).

In the long run, the TC will continue to recruit new ACM SIGDOC members, perform outreach to existing industry/academic partnerships, and promote new opportunities for collaboration (internships, research, and career development materials).

To add comments/suggestions to the charter, edit [Comments: Structured Information Development and Management Charter (DRAFT)](charter_comments.md).

## Proposed TC Activities and Deliverables (DRAFT)

The following items are guesses what would be useful activities and publications for current and future ACM SIGDOC members -- practitioners, instructors, researchers, and students. 

1. Technical papers suitable for publication through the ACM SIGDOC web site sigdoc.acm.org.
2. Primers on structured information, content management, metadata taxonomies, and related topics to be made available to ACM SIGDOC members and to the students they support. 
3. Tutorials and tutorial-oriented webinars.
4. Technical workshops at the fall ACM SIGDOC national conferences.
5. Pedagogical workshops in the spring for teachers interested in integrating structured authoring solutions such as DITA into their curricula.
6. Social media postings about new developments and trends in structured information.
7. Industry speaker directory - a list of industry practitioners upon whom teachers could call for demonstrations, lectures, and workshops.
