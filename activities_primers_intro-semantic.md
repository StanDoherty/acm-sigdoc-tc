# Introduction to Semantic Markup (DRAFT)

In Boston (pronounced Bawstin), we cherish our regional vocabulary. The word "pissah", for example, can denote *joy* ("You found your car keys! That's pissah!"),  *sympathy* ("Pissah! You lost your $20 scratcher ticket?"), or *abject admiration* ("He outran a Statie in *that* car? He's wicked pissah."). Since we began to understand the conversations surrounding us a toddlers up to the most recent debate on who was the worst Red Sox manager, we have individually absorbed and integrated the meaning of all those conversations into a mesh or network of sorts. Structuralists such as  Ferdinand de Saussure called this our *langue*, our repository of all things that we could understand or choose to express using language. Items in that repository contain much more than accepted definitions for words because we absorbed these words and their meanings in specific contexts. Part science, part culture, and part lobster stew. Any instance of language that we express (*parole*) carries with it both conventional meanings for words and a whole lot of context. The exclamation (usage) "That's really pissah!" lacks sufficient context for us to exclude any one of the meanings that we have accumulated over time. 

Yes - this has all been leading up to the word "semantic" and what we might make of "semantic markup".
