# Comments: Structured Information Development and Management Charter (DRAFT)

This TC seeks to promote the benefits of structured information and information management for industry practitioners and teachers. Under the guidance of the SIGDOC Executive Committee, our proposed TC would be active in developing technical papers, pedagogical (curriculum) content, webinar workshop materials, conference workshop materials, and industry speaker directories. 

We have two short-term activities:

* *Before SIGDOC approval*: Recruit founding members from industry and academia who are supportive of the work of the proposed TC.
* *After SIGDOC approval*: Develop an initial set of deliverables for the [2022 ACM SIGDOC Conference](https://sigdoc.acm.org/conferences/) (October 6-8).

In the long run, the TC will continue to recruit new ACM SIGDOC members, perform outreach to existing industry/academic partnerships, and promote new opportunities for collaboration (internships, research, and career development materials).
